const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is Cosmetic Dentistry?",
    a: "Cosmetic dentistry refers to dental treatments specifically designed to enhance the aesthetics, symmetry, alignment, and color of your smile. Treatments range from single-tooth composite bonding and custom porcelain veneers to full-mouth rehabilitation and clear aligners.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do porcelain veneers last?",
    a: "High-quality porcelain veneers typically last between 15 to 20+ years with proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups. Because medical-grade porcelain is non-porous, veneers will never discolour or stain from coffee, tea, or wine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is cosmetic dental treatment painful?",
    a: "Not at all. We utilize modern gentle local anaesthetics, computer-guided numbing, and minimally invasive techniques to ensure complete comfort throughout every procedure. Conscious sedation options are also readily available.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between composite bonding and porcelain veneers?",
    a: "Composite bonding is applied in a single appointment by hand-sculpting aesthetic resin onto the tooth with minimal or no enamel removal, lasting 5–8 years. Porcelain veneers are custom ceramic shells offering superior translucency, stain resistance, and durability lasting 15–20+ years.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a smile makeover cost?",
    a: "Because every smile makeover is tailored to your unique anatomical goals, pricing varies. Single-tooth composite bonding starts from £150, while bespoke porcelain veneers start from £595 per tooth. We provide full itemized quotes and 0% APR finance from £35/month.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can cosmetic dentistry fix crooked teeth without braces?",
    a: "Yes! Minor crowding, gaps, and rotated teeth can frequently be corrected instantly using porcelain veneers or composite bonding. For moderate to severe misalignment, we also provide clear aligner systems.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are cosmetic treatments covered by the NHS?",
    a: "Cosmetic dental procedures performed purely for aesthetic improvement are classified as private treatments. However, if a tooth requires a restoration due to severe decay or trauma affecting oral health, NHS Band 3 coverage may apply.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my new smile look natural?",
    a: "Absolutely. Our master ceramists layer multi-tonal porcelains with natural incisal translucency and bespoke micro-surface texture to ensure your new smile looks seamlessly authentic in every lighting condition.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the entire makeover process take?",
    a: "Composite bonding is completed in a single 1 to 2-hour appointment. Porcelain veneers typically require two visits spaced 1 to 2 weeks apart: visit one for digital scans and trial smile mock-up, and visit two for permanent bonding.",
  },
  {
    q: "What financing options are available?",
    a: "We offer 0% APR interest-free payment plans spread over 12 to 24 months, with zero deposit required on approved credit. You can spread repayments into predictable monthly amounts starting from £35/month.",
  },
