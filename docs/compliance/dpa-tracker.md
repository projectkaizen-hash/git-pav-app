## 2. Technical Safeguards (Enforced in Code)

1. **Strict Data Minimisation in Outbound Alerts:**
   - Transactional emails (Postmark) and SMS alerts (Twilio) contain only administrative metadata (time, date, clinic address) and security codes. Clinical services and diagnosis details are never sent via SMS or email.
2. **Client-Side Card Tokenization:**
   - Payment credentials never touch Pav Dental application servers or databases; all card details are tokenised directly with Stripe.
3. **Application-Level Master Key Encryption:**
   - Sensitive clinical notes and access codes are encrypted at the application layer with AES-256-GCM using `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
4. **Isolated Test Environments:**
   - Local and CI test suites use in-memory and synthetic fixtures (`@example.test`); external processors are mocked or stubbed out.
