# Pav Dental: production-readiness checklist and release gates

Rewritten on 26 Oct 2026 from the audit in [`../completion/07-architecture-audit.md`](../completion/07-architecture-audit.md). The previous version listed environment variables that don't exist, promised an "EAS Update rollback" the app can't do, and marked items passed without evidence; it is replaced, not amended.

**Scope.** The mobile app (`pavdental/`), the API (`backend/`) and the staff dashboard screens for app data (`admin-dashboard/`). The website is de-scoped except for the legal pages the app links to.

**Status values.** **Verified** (evidence linked, re-checked on the date given) · **Failed** (checked and not met) · **Not tested** · **Blocked** (waiting on something named) · **N/A**.

A passing build is not readiness. Every row needs its evidence before the gate it belongs to can open.

## 1. Release gates

Release to real patients needs **every gate open**. A gate can only be waived by the owner (hisham) in writing, recorded in [`../completion/04-decisions.md`](../completion/04-decisions.md) with the risk accepted, who accepted it and an expiry date. Gates G1, G2 and G7 cannot be waived for a Critical security issue, an unresolved data-loss risk or a broken essential journey.

| Gate | Opens when | Status (26 Oct) |
|---|---|---|
| **G1 Code health** | CI green on the release commit: typecheck, lint, jest, e2e, migration drift, dependency gate, CodeQL, expo-doctor | Verified locally on `aa0133b` (except expo-doctor and CodeQL, CI-only); re-check on the release commit |
| **G2 No open Critical/High security findings** | Pen test done (QA-08), its Critical/High fixed and retested; no unreviewed high/critical advisories | Blocked: pen test not booked |
| **G3 Essential journeys work on real devices** | Section 2 rows Verified on an EAS build, iOS and Android | Not tested |
| **G4 Data safety** | Production PITR on; restore drill done within the last 90 days and within RTO; bucket versioning on | Blocked: no production stack (OPS-01) |
| **G5 Operable** | Errors from API, app and dashboard reach Sentry with readable stacks; uptime alert on `/readyz` reaches a person; job-lag alert; incident runbook | Failed: Sentry optional, no source maps, no uptime check |
| **G6 Safe release path** | Branch protection; Render deploys only after CI; pre-deploy migrations; rollback rehearsed once | Failed: Render deploys every push; manual migrations |
| **G7 Legal and clinical** | Privacy notice and terms reviewed and published; DPAs accepted; DPIA signed; ICO fee paid; CQC scope confirmed; clinical sign-off of triage, prescribing and patient-facing clinical wording; D-18 advice | Blocked: legal and clinical review (LG-01..08) |
| **G8 Production soak** | Production stack running 7 days with synthetic data; reminders, hold expiry and push receipts observed working overnight; load test met targets | Blocked: G4 |
| **G9 Store approval** | Apple and Google listings, privacy labels, Data safety form and reviewer account complete; builds approved | Blocked: C-01, C-02 (owner provides at production time) |
